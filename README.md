### Fixed Point group
---
Main object of this group is to upgrade existing MyHDL module version 0.9 to a new version 0.10 in order to test properties of fixed point matrix multiplication.
Addidionaly, we would like to extend existing tutorial base  to quickstart beginners.

#### QuickStart guide
Go to *tutorial.md* and follow the instruction to install MyHDL on your computer.

#### Fixed point arithmetic
- quick description of what fixed point actually is
- ----||--- marix multiplication
- methods of implementing


#### ToDo (12.11.2018)
- write instruction for instalation of MyHDL in ubuntu 18.04
- get acquinted with fixed point documentation
- force upgrade fixed_point module to 0.10 and create set of benches to benchmark performance
---
- write readme in concise manner
